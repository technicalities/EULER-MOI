### My solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.

A course of technical weight-training. C# and Haskell. These begin very gently and ramp up to some gnarly business indeed, involving maths textbooks and TAOCP.

My gimmick is that my solutions are abstracted methods - so I can't enter plausible bounds for the specific value in the problem. If I want to hack at all, I must hack the whole domain!


### General scheme:
1. Get something working
2. Limit the [domain](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Domain_of_a_function) or other search space somehow (with: clever initialisations, clever loop conditions, binary search).
3. Usual software optimisation. 
4. What special cases does the target belong to? Narrow the codomain.
